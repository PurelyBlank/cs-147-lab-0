# Lab 0: [Lab Title]

## Overview
In this project, I will work with the ESP32 board and the PlatformIO development environment in Visual Studio Code to build a light meter using a photo-resistor and a servo motor. The light meter will respond to the surrounding light intensity by controlling the servo motor based on sensor readings. 

The project consists of two phases:

- **Calibration Phase**: I will measure and store the maximum and minimum light levels.
- **Operation Phase**: Using the mapped sensor values, the servo will move between 0 and 179 degrees based on the detected light intensity.

Aiming to demonstrate proficiency experience with digital and analog I/O, serial communication, and setting up PlatformIO in VS Code.


## Requirements
